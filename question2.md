# Student 2's Answer to Question 2

**Q2.** Assign variables to the individual components of your favorite gene! 
(e.g. promoter, 5' UTR, start codon, exon1, intron, exon2, stop codon, 3'UTR)
. Print the entire gene by using the string concatenation operator on the
standart output! Note: Feel free to create a fictional gene sequence by
randomly filling in the components.
